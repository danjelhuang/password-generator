# Password Generator

Sometimes automatically generated passwords violate the contraints of the password pattern that a given organization is asking for. Violations include generating characters that are not allowed, generating too many numbers, generating too many different types of characters, etc.

This extension aims to fix those annoying violations when generating a password. A user can tell the extension the specific pattern the organization is looking for in the password.
